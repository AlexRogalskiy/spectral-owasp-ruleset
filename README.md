# Spectral OWASP API Security

Scan an [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) document to detect security issues. As OpenAPI is only describing the surface level of the API it cannot see what is happening in your code, but it can spot obvious issues and outdated standards being used.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install --save -D @philsturgeon/spectral-owasp-ruleset
npm install --save -D @stoplight/spectral-cli
```

## Usage


Create a local ruleset that extends the ruleset. In its most basic form this just tells Spectral what ruleset you want to use, but it will allow you to customise things, add your own rules, turn bits off if its causing trouble.

```
cd ~/src/<your-api>

echo 'extends: ["@philsturgeon/spectral-owasp-ruleset"]' > .spectral.yaml
```

_If you're using VS Code or Stoplight Studio then the NPM modules will not be available. Instead you can use the CDN hosted version:_

```
echo 'extends: ["https://unpkg.com/@philsturgeon/spectral-owasp-ruleset@1.0/dist/ruleset.js"]' > .spectral.yaml
```

Next, use Spectral CLI to lint against your OpenAPI description. Don't have any OpenAPI? [Record some HTTP traffic to make OpenAPI](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/creating-openapi-from-http-traffic) and then you can switch to API Design-First going forwards.

```
spectral lint api/openapi.yaml
```

You should see some output like this:

```
/Users/phil/src/protect-earth-api/api/openapi.yaml
  44:17      warning  owasp:api3:2019-define-error-responses-400:400 response should be defined.. Missing responses[400]  paths./upload.post.responses
  44:17      warning  owasp:api3:2019-define-error-responses-429:429 response should be defined.. Missing responses[429]  paths./upload.post.responses
  44:17      warning  owasp:api3:2019-define-error-responses-500:500 response should be defined.. Missing responses[500]  paths./upload.post.responses

 210:16  information  owasp:api2:2019-protection-global-safe      This operation is not protected by any security scheme.  paths./species.get.security
```

Now you have some things to work on for your API. Thankfully these are only at the `warning` and `information` severity, and that is not going to [fail continuous integration](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjExNTMyOTAx-continuous-integration) (unless [you want them to](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/ZG9jOjI1MTg1-spectral-cli#error-results)).

There are [a bunch of other rulesets](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral-rulesets) you can use, or use for inspiration for your own rulesets and API Style Guides.

## ðŸŽ‰ Thanks

- [Andrzej](https://github.com/jerzyn) - Great rules contributed to the Adidas style guide.
- [Roberto Polli](https://github.com/ioggstream) - Created lots of excellent Spectral rules for [API OAS Checker](https://github.com/italia/api-oas-checker/) which aligned with the OWASP API rules.

If you'd like to say thanks for this style guide, throw some money at [Protect Earth](https://protect.earth/donate), a charity that plants trees all over the United Kingdom, which has [secured a 64 acre ancient woodland to restore](https://www.protect.earth/blog/high-wood). Phil spends all his time on this, both planting trees _and_ writing APIs believe it or not!
