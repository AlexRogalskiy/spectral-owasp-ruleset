     * API8:2019 ‚Äî Injection
     *
     * Attackers construct API calls that include SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS, or other commands that the API or the backend behind it blindly executes.

     * Use cases
     * - ‚ùå Attackers send malicious input to be forwarded to an internal interpreter:
     *
     * How to prevent
     * - üü† Never trust your API consumers, even if they are internal.
     * - üü† Strictly define all input data, such as schemas, types, and string patterns, and enforce them at runtime.
     * - ‚ùå Validate, filter, and sanitize all incoming data.
     * - üü† Define, limit, and enforce API outputs to prevent data leaks.

    /**
     * API9:2019 ‚Äî Improper assets management
     *
     * Attackers find non-production versions of the API (for example, staging, testing, beta, or earlier versions) that are not as well protected as the production API, and use those to launch their attacks.
     *
     * Use case
     * - ‚ùå DevOps, the cloud, containers, and Kubernetes make having multiple deployments easy (for example, dev, test, branches, staging, old versions).
     * - ‚ùå Desire to maintain backward compatibility forces to leave old APIs running.
     * - üü† Old or non-production versions are not properly maintained, but these endpoints still have access to production data.
     * - ‚ùå Once authenticated with one endpoint, attackers may switch to the other, production one.
     *
     * How to prevent
     * - ‚ùå Keep an up-to-date inventory all API hosts.
     * - ‚ùå Limit access to anything that should not be public.
     * - ‚ùå Limit access to production data, and segregate access to production and non-production data.
     * - ‚ùå Implement additional external controls, such as API firewalls.
     * - üü† Properly retire old versions of APIs or backport security fixes to them.
     * - üü† Implement strict authentication, redirects, CORS, and so forth.
